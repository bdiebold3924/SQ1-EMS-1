Began integration of all classes.
Created SQI-EMSI as the mainline of program.
The following changes were made to theCompany class and its methods:
1. Changed the name of class TheCompany to theCompany avoid name issues with its namespace.
2. List<object> is now List<Employee>
3. Remove now takes the employees SIN as a parameter and uses that to traverse the list of employees to find the one to remove
4. Add now takes a second bool parameter to determine if the employee is valid
5. Traverse goes through the list of employees and adds the details of each to a string, then returns that string or an error string if the database is empty
6. Added a second traverse method (Traverse(string SIN)) which looks through the list find an employee with that SIN and returns its details. An empty string is returned if no employee is found
7. Removed the logic from the constructor that set the list to null
The following changes were made to the UIMenu class and its methods:
1. Integrated the the following methods from the TheCompany and SupportClass Class Libraries: SaveDatabase, LoadDatabase, Remove, Traverse()
2. Added logic to parse the List<string> returned from LoadDatabase and create the employees from that.
3. Finished the employeeManagementMenu()
4. Added a second employeeDetailsMenu function for adding employees (original one is for modifying employees)
The following changes were made to the AllEmployees class library, its classes, and their methods:
1. Separated the employee classes into individual files
2. Made each employee class public
3. Added parent employee class' constructor parameters to the children's constructors
4. Made each constructor set the employee type
